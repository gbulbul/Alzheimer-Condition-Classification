Alzeihmer classification is an essential task to take precautions for prevention and improve its treatment. DL and ML approaches are used to achieve this task. In this context, classification task aims to assign a patient into a correct group of alzeihmer to specify treatment while there are 4 groups defined.

The above figure shows the four groups of dementia. The dementia classes can be codified like this NonDemented:0, ModerateDemented:1, MildDemented:2, VeryMildDemented:3. 

7 deep learning models were compared in terms of accuracy for the classification task. From the given table below, it looks like ResNet outperformed others with respect to accuracy for the task of interest.
